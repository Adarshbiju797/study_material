# JavaScript Learning Path

# Basics of JavaScript

1. **Variables and Data Types:** Learn about var, let, and const, and data types like string, number, boolean, array, object, null, undefined, and symbol.
    **Variables**
        **Variables in JavaScript can be declared using var, let, or const. Each has different characteristics:**
            **var:** Function-scoped or globally scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
            **let:** Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared within the same scope, but can be updated.
            **const:** Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared or updated.
                // var example
                var x = 5;
                console.log(x); // Output: 5
                x = 10; // Reassigning value
                console.log(x); // Output: 10

                // let example
                let y = 20;
                console.log(y); // Output: 20
                y = 30; // Reassigning value
                console.log(y); // Output: 30

                // const example
                const z = 50;
                console.log(z); // Output: 50
                // z = 60; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

    **Data Types**
        **JavaScript has several data types categorized into two groups: primitive and non-primitive.**
            **Primitive Data Types**
                **String:** Represents text, enclosed in single quotes ('...'), double quotes ("..."), or backticks (`...`).
                    let greeting = "Hello, World!";
                    console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, World!
                **Number:** Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
                    let age = 25;          // Integer
                    let price = 19.99;     // Float
                    console.log(age);      // Output: 25
                    console.log(price);    // Output: 19.99
                **Boolean:** Represents logical values, either true or false.
                    let isJavaScriptFun = true;
                    let isSleeping = false;
                    console.log(isJavaScriptFun); // Output: true
                    console.log(isSleeping);      // Output: false
                **Undefined:** A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value is undefined.  
                    let myVar;
                    console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
                **Null:** Represents an explicitly empty or non-existent value.
                    let emptyValue = null;
                    console.log(emptyValue); // Output: null
                **Symbol:** A unique and immutable value oftenlet symbol1 = Symbol('description');
                    let symbol1 = Symbol('description');
                    let symbol2 = Symbol('description');
                    console.log(symbol1 === symbol2); // Output: false (each symbol is unique)
            **Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types**
                **Object:** A collection of key-value pairs. Objects can store various data types.
                    let person = {
                        name: "Alice",
                        age: 30,
                        isStudent: false
                    };
                    console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
                **Array:** An ordered collection of values (elements), which can be of mixed data types.       

2. **Operators:** Learn arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and ternary operators.
    **Arithmetic Operators** : Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.
        Operator	Description
            +	    Addition	
            -	    Subtraction
            *	    Multiplication	
            /	    Division	
            %	    Modulus (remainder)	
            ++	    Increment (adds 1)	
            --	    Decrement (subtracts 1)

        //example
            let a = 10, b = 3;
            console.log(a + b); // Output: 13
            console.log(a - b); // Output: 7
            console.log(a * b); // Output: 30
            console.log(a / b); // Output: 3.333...
            console.log(a % b); // Output: 1

    **Comparison Operators** : Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a Boolean (true or false).
        Operator	Description	                        Example	    Result
            ==	        Equal to	                    5 == '5'	true
            ===	        Strict equal to (type + value)	5 === '5'	false
            !=	        Not equal to	                5 != '5'	false
            !==	        Strict not equal to	            5 !== '5'	true
            >	        Greater than	                5 > 2	    true
            <	        Less than	                    5 < 2	    false
            >=	        Greater than or equal to	    5 >= 5	    true
            <=	        Less than or equal to	        5 <= 2	    false

        //example
            let x = 5, y = '5';
            console.log(x == y);  // Output: true (checks only value)
            console.log(x === y); // Output: false (checks value and type)
            console.log(x > 3);   // Output: true
            console.log(x <= 5);  // Output: true

    **Logical Operators** : Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions.
        Operator	Description	                                     Example	       Result
            &&	        Logical AND (true if both true)	        (5 > 3) && (4 < 6)	    true
            `		                                            `	                    Logical OR (true if either true)
            !	        Logical NOT (inverts boolean value)	    !(5 > 3)	            false

        //example
            let a = true, b = false;
            console.log(a && b); // Output: false (both need to be true)
            console.log(a || b); // Output: true (either one is true)
            console.log(!a);     // Output: false (negation of true is false)

    **Assignment Operators** : Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is =.
        Operator	Description	            Example	    Equivalent To
            =	    Assigns a value	        x = 5	    x = 5
            +=	    Adds and assigns	    x += 3	    x = x + 3
            -=	    Subtracts and assigns	x -= 3	    x = x - 3
            *=	    Multiplies and assigns	x *= 3	    x = x * 3
            /=	    Divides and assigns	    x /= 3	    x = x / 3
            %=	    Modulus and assigns	    x %= 3	    x = x % 3

        //example
            let x = 10;
            x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5
            console.log(x); // Output: 15

            x *= 2; // Equivalent to x = x * 2
            console.log(x); // Output: 30

    **Ternary (Conditional) Operator** The ternary operator is a shorthand for the if...else statement. It takes three operands: a condition, an expression if true, and an expression if false.

    **Syntax:**
        condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

    //example
        let age = 18;
        let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
        console.log(canVote); // Output: Yes

3. **Control Structures:** if, else if, else, switch, for, while, do...while.

    **if Statement** : The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

    //example
        let age = 18;

        if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("You are an adult."); // Output: You are an adult.
        }

    **if...else Statement** : The if...else statement executes one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if it is false.

    //example
        let age = 16;

        if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("You are an adult.");
        } else {
        console.log("You are not an adult."); // Output: You are not an adult.
        }

    **if...else if...else Statement** : The if...else if...else statement is used when there are multiple conditions to check. It runs the first block of code for which the condition is true.

    //example
        let score = 75;

        if (score >= 90) {
        console.log("Grade: A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
        console.log("Grade: B");
        } else if (score >= 70) {
        console.log("Grade: C"); // Output: Grade: C
        } else {
        console.log("Grade: F");
        }

    **switch Statement** : The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It's more efficient than using multiple if...else if...else statements when you have many conditions based on the same value.

    //example
        let day = 3;
        let dayName;

        switch (day) {
        case 1:
            dayName = "Monday";
            break;
        case 2:
            dayName = "Tuesday";
            break;
        case 3:
            dayName = "Wednesday";
            break; // Output: Wednesday
        case 4:
            dayName = "Thursday";
            break;
        default:
            dayName = "Invalid day";
        }

        console.log(dayName);

    **Looping Statements**

    **for Loop** : The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

        **Syntax**
            for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                // code block to be executed
            }

        //example
            for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                console.log(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
            }

        
    **while Loop** : The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known, and it runs as long as the specified condition is true.
        
        **Syntax**
            while (condition) {
                // code block to be executed
            }

        //example
            let i = 1;

            while (i <= 5) {
                console.log(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
                i++;
            }

    **do...while Loop** : The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once, regardless of the condition.

        **Syntax**
            do {
                // code block to be executed
            } while (condition);

        //example
            let i = 1;

            do {
            console.log(i); // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
            i++;
            } while (i <= 5);

4. **Functions:** How to declare functions, arrow functions, and function expressions.
    Function Declarations : A function declaration defines a named function. It can be called before it is declared due to JavaScript's hoisting mechanism.

        function functionName(parameters) {
        // code to be executed
        }

        function greet(name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
        }

        console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!

    Function Expressions : A function expression is a function that is assigned to a variable. Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted, meaning they cannot be called before they are defined.

        const variableName = function(parameters) {
        // code to be executed
        };


        const greet = function(name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
        };

        console.log(greet("Bob")); // Output: Hello, Bob!

    Arrow Functions : Arrow functions are a more concise syntax introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). They do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target bindings, making them particularly useful in situations where you want to maintain the context of this from the surrounding code.

        const functionName = (parameters) => {
        // code to be executed
        };

    If the function has only one parameter, parentheses around the parameter are optional. If the function has a single statement that returns a value, you can omit the braces {} and the return keyword.

    Arrow Function with Multiple Parameters

        const sum = (a, b) => {
        return a + b;
        };

        console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8

    Arrow Function with a Single Parameter (Parentheses Optional)

        const greet = name => "Hello, " + name + "!";

        console.log(greet("Charlie")); // Output: Hello, Charlie!

    Arrow Function with Implicit Return

        const square = x => x * x;

        console.log(square(4)); // Output: 16


    Key Differences Between Function Declarations, Function Expressions, and Arrow Functions
    Hoisting:

    Function Declarations are hoisted, so they can be called before they are defined.
    Function Expressions are not hoisted, so they must be defined before they are called.
    Arrow Functions behave like function expressions and are not hoisted.
    this Context:

    Function Declarations and Function Expressions have their own this context depending on how they are called.
    Arrow Functions do not have their own this; they inherit this from the enclosing scope, making them particularly useful in methods and callbacks.
    Syntax and Usage:

    Function Declarations are more verbose but can make code easier to read and maintain.
    Function Expressions provide flexibility by allowing anonymous functions and can be used as values.
    Arrow Functions offer a concise syntax and are well-suited for short functions or where this context preservation is needed.
